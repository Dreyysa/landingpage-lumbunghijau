There is no code to write for an image file. The instructions describe updating code, but the file is an image. The update requests replacing the image with a new screenshot. Therefore, the task is to replace the existing `img/app-preview.jpg` with the new Lumbung Hijau app screenshot. Since I cannot directly manipulate files, the response is simply an acknowledgement of the task.
